# Balloon

This is university assignment project for Computer Graphics. It's compiled with Visual Studio 2015 Community and is using freeglut, glew, antTweakBar and glm.

It's a very simplistic simulation of a flight in a hot air balloon over procedurally generated terrain.
This is my first shot at procedural generation so it implements quite simple algorithm - Diamond Square.

Geometry is both colored and generated in code. There are few camera types to select from.
Thanks to AntTweakBar generation parameters are configurable.
